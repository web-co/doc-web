						<p class="text_title">HOW MANY POINTS DO I START WITH?</p>
						<p>Every time you secure a customer you are given 4 free points to use.  Based on meeting or failing to meet certain requirements, you may be eligible to earn point bonuses or you may be subject to point deductions</p>
						<p class="text_title">MINIMUM EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENT</p>
						<p>To be entitled to compensation, a customer must have a minimum of 4 points of alarm equipment installed including at least 1 yard sign.</p>
						<p class="text_title blue">FACTS</p>
						<p class="text_title">What If I Want to Use More Points?</p>
						<p>You may give a customer more than the allotted points, but you will be charged $35 per point given above your allotment</p>
						<p class="text_title">Cost of Points</p>
						<p>Points cost you $35 per point given above your allotment</p>
						<p class="text_title">Point Reconciliation</p>
						<p>Points will be reconciled at the customer or account level.  If too many points are given to a customer (a “points short-fall”), you will receive an upfront deduction from your compensation ($35 per point over your allotment).  You may bank up to 2 unused points on a customer or account.</p>
						<p class="text_title">Point Bank and Points Corrective Bonus</p>
						<p>Except as provided below, banked points have no cash value AND may only be used prospectively and applied to new customer/accounts in the event of a subsequent point’s short-fall.  Any remaining unused banked points will be forfeited.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="content_block">
				
					<div>
						<p class="text_title blue">MMR (MONTHLY MONITORING RATE)</p>
						<p>The MMR you charge the customer varies by the type of system you choose to install in their home.</p>
						<p class="text_title">Lowering MMR</p>
						<p>If you choose to lower the base rate for a customer, you will receive a 1 point deduction for each $1 reduction below the Suggested MMR (see Package Summary).  You may <u>not</u> lower a customer’s base rate below the Minimum MMR (see Package Summary).</p>
						<p class="text_title">Increasing MMR</p>
						<p>If you choose to increase the base rate for a customer, you will receive a 1 point bonus for each $1 increase above the Suggested MMR (see Package Summary).  These extra points may be used to cover extra equipment installed in a customer’s home or you may bank up to 2 unused points on a new customer for future use.</p>
						<p class="text_title blue" style="padding-top: 10px;">UPFRONT ACTIVATION FEES</p>
						<p>The upfront activation fee is the money collected to cover the cost of installing/activating the system in a customer’s home.  You should collect upfront activation fees for every system you sell.</p>
						<p class="text_title">Amount</p>
						<p>The amount of the Expected Activation Fee is set forth on the Package Summary and is determined based on the following factors:</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>Whether the customer is an owner or renter;</li>
							<li>The customer’s credit class; and</li>
							<li>The package and equipment installed in the customer’s home.</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="text_title">Waiving/Reducing Activation Fees</p>
						<p>If you fail to collect the full Expected Activation Fee (see Package Summary), you will receive a deduction from your compensation equal to the uncollected portion of the Expected Activation Fee.</p>
						<p>If you fail to collect at least $99 of activation fee, you will not receive the 5 point or 3 point (if paid in-full within 3 months) Activation Fee Bonus, and you will receive a 1 point upfront deduction (i.e., a 6 point difference).</p>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						<p>You may NOT waive the $50 mandatory outdoor camera activation fee.</p>
						<p class="text_title">Increasing Activation Fees</p>
						<p>You will receive 1 point for every $35 of additional activation fee collected at time of installation over the Expected Activation Fee</p>
						<p class="text_title blue" style="padding-top: 10px;">PAYMENT RULES</p>
						<p class="text_title">Manual Billing – Credit Class A+ and A Owners ONLY</p>
						<p>Manual billing is <u>only</u> permitted for Credit Class A+ and A customer owners.  If you allow a Credit Class A+ or A customer to choose the manual billing payment option, you will receive a 4 point upfront deduction, and you will not receive the +½ point for ACH Payment.</p>
						<p class="text_title"  style="padding-top: 20px;">Credit/Debit Card – Credit Class A+, A, B & C Owners ONLY</p>
						<p>The credit/debit payment option is <u>only</u> permitted for Credit Class A+, A, B and C customers that are owners.  However, prepaid cards ARE NOT PERMITTED.  If you allow a Credit Class A+, A, B or C customer to choose the credit or debit card payment option, you will receive a 2 point upfront deduction, and you will not receive the ½ point for ACH Payment.</p>
						<p class="text_title">ACH Payment</p>
						<p>ACH checking is the <u>only</u> permitted payment option for renters (regardless of credit class) and Credit Class E, F and Z customers.  If you collect ACH checking as the form of payment, you will receive the +½ point for ACH Payment.</p>
						<p class="text_title">First Month’s Payment</p>
						<p>You should always try to collect the first month’s MMR in-full at time of installation.  If you fail to do so, you will receive a 2 point upfront deduction. However, you will only receive a 1 point upfront deduction if you collect the pro-rated MMR at time of installation and customer pays a full-month’s MMR within 30-days of installation.</p>

					<div>
						<p class="text_title">Smart Home Promotion – Added Automation Devices</p>
						<p>When you sell a Smart Home Package other than a Smart Home Takeover Package (i.e., a Smart Home and Smart Home Plus Life Safety), you will be paid a $25 commission for EACH new Automation device (see Point Value table) added to the package starting with the second device (i.e., the commission does NOT apply to the first new Automation device).</p>
						<p class="text_title">Submitting the Agreement</p>
						<p>Each Agreement for Monitoring and Installation of Security Systems (Customer Agreement)* and Affirmation of Understanding (if applicable) should be completed electronically by a customer through the Alder App if the customer agrees to electronic signatures and communications. The eSign Consent must be signed by the customer when they begin the electronic agreement process.</p>
						<p>If a customer is unable to electronically sign a Customer Agreement, check the “No Email Available” box in the Alder App.  Present a completed paper Customer Agreement to the customer for their review and signature.  Leave the completed Customer Agreement with the customer.</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>If you have a cellular signal, scan and upload the signed Customer Agreement to the Alder App and it will automatically be submitted to Alder.</li>
							<li>If you do not have a cellular signal, select the “Offline Accounts” mode in the Alder App.  Enter the customer account number into the Alder App and then scan the Customer Agreement to the Alder App.  It will be automatically submitted to Alder when you sign into the Alder App and have a cellular signal.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>With each Customer Agreement, remember to verbally notify each customer of his/her 3-day right of rescission (5-day right in Alaska) and leave them with two dated and fully-completed Notices of Cancellation (NOC).  If the customer signed an electronic Customer Agreement, the customer will receive the two completed copies of the NOC via email.  If you completed a hard copy of the Customer Agreement, scan the page with the state specific sections and NOC to the Alder App and leave the customer with a hard copy of the two completed NOC.</p>
						<p><em>*You must only use the correct state specific Customer Agreement, which includes the state specific sections and NOC.</em></p>
						<p class="text_title">Switchover Policy</p>
						<p>In order to sign up a new customer that is currently receiving monitoring services from another provider (for purposes of this policy, the “<u>Previous Provider</u>”) (whether or not new equipment is to be provided), you <u>MUST</u> comply with the following:</p>
						<ol class="list">
							<li>You must FULLY resolve (i.e., pay or otherwise obtain a release) any remaining balance of the customer’s contract with his/her Previous Provider; and</li>
							<li>You must obtain from the customer and submit to Alder with a fully-completed and executed contract, a completed and signed Affirmation of Understanding (Form C).</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						<p>If you fail to strictly comply with this policy, then Alder may elect, in its sole discretion, to impose any one or more of the following remedies:</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>Deduct any amounts paid by Alder to the customer’s Previous Provider to resolve (or partially resolve) a customer’s balance with his/her Previous Provider from any compensation due or otherwise payable to you;</li>
							<li>Designate the customer/account as being a Non-Qualified Contract for which you will not be entitled to any compensation for such customer/account, if Alder has paid more than $400 to resolve (or partially resolve) a customer’s balance with his/her Previous Provider or if you fail to obtain and provide to Alder a completed and signed Affirmation of Understanding;</li>
							<li>Asses you a 2 point upfront deduction; and</li>
							<li>Impose a fine or other disciplinary action.</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="text_title">Licensing</p>
						<p>You may not work without being properly licensed in both the state and local jurisdiction.  Some areas require that a license is merely submitted, while others require you have the license in hand before working.  </p>
						<p class="text_title">Collections</p>
						<p>You are financially responsible for all collection costs and expenses incurred by Alder on all of your customers/accounts.</p>
						<p>If any customer/account of yours becomes delinquent for 6 or more consecutive months (a “<u>Delinquent Account</u>”), then you will be obligated to return to Alder ALL equipment installed with respect to such customer/account upon 30-days’ notice from Alder.  If you fail to return the equipment in good working order within such 30-day period, the Alder may elect, in its sole discretion, to either:</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>Deduct the value of such equipment from any compensation due or otherwise payable to you; or</li>
							<li>Invoice you for the value of such equipment with such invoice being due and payable within 30-days after invoice.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Also, if you would otherwise be entitled to residual compensation for a customer/account, then:</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>For any month in which payment on anyt customer/account is not timely made, there will be deducted from any other compensation due or otherwise payable to you a $25 collection fee; and</li>
							<li>If any customer/account becomes a Delinquent Account, then such customer/account shall thereafter be designated a Non-Qualified Contract for which you will not be entitled to any further residual compensation (even if the delinquency is subsequently cured).</li>
